# Softcar Map Parser

## Introduction

Softcar Map Parser is a powerful desktop application built using Angular and Electron. It is designed to parse `.map` files generated by compilers and linkers, providing developers with detailed insights into their application's memory layout. The application features an interactive dashboard for visualizing memory usage, helping developers analyze memory segments, symbols, and sections efficiently. By combining the flexibility of Angular with the native capabilities of Electron, Softcar Map Parser offers a seamless cross-platform experience for optimizing and understanding embedded software memory consumption.

## Features

- **Map File Parsing**: Accurately parse `.map` files to extract memory segments, symbols, and section details.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize memory usage with dynamic charts powered by ApexCharts, including bar charts, pie charts, and more.
- **Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination**: Easily navigate large datasets with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination controls.
- **JSON MCU Profiles**: Support for JSON-based MCU profiles to tailor parsing and visualization to specific microcontroller architectures.
- **Cross-Platform Builds**: Build and run the application on Windows, macOS, and Linux using Electronâ€™s packaging capabilities.

## Libraries Used

- **Bootstrap**: Utilized for responsive design and UI components, ensuring the application adapts beautifully across various devices and screen sizes.
- **FontAwesome**: Provides a rich set of vector icons used throughout the UI to enhance visual appeal and usability.
- **ng-apexcharts / ApexCharts**: The charting library used for rendering interactive and responsive charts. ApexCharts offers a wide range of chart types and customization options, making it ideal for visualizing complex memory data. For more information, visit [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/).

## Project Structure

- `src/app`: Contains the main Angular application components, services, modules, and business logic.
- `src/shared`: Houses shared utilities, models, types, and helper functions used across the app.
- `dist`: The output directory where the Angular build artifacts are stored after compilation.
- `main-process.ts`: The Electron main process script responsible for managing the application lifecycle, window creation, and native integrations.
- `preload.ts`: The Electron preload script that exposes safe APIs and facilitates secure communication between the Electron main process and the Angular renderer process.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd softcar-map-parser
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Angular development server:**

   This will start the Angular app on `http://localhost:4200/` with live reloading.

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

4. **Run Electron application:**

   To start the application as a desktop app using Electron, run:

   ```bash
   npm run start-electron
   ```

## Build Instructions

Softcar Map Parser provides scripts to build the Electron desktop app for different platforms:

- **Windows:**

  ```bash
  npm run dist:win
  ```

- **macOS:**

  ```bash
  npm run dist:mac
  ```

- **All supported platforms:**

  ```bash
  npm run dist:all
  ```

These commands package the Angular build with Electron into standalone desktop executables.

## Angular and Electron Interaction

The Angular frontend is compiled into static files located in the `dist/` directory. Electron's main process loads these files into a browser window, rendering the Angular application as a native desktop app. The `main-process.ts` script manages the Electron lifecycle and window creation, while `preload.ts` securely exposes APIs and facilitates communication between the Electron main process and Angular renderer process, maintaining security and performance.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Run unit tests using the Karma test runner with the command:

  ```bash
  ng test
  ```

- **End-to-End Tests:** Execute end-to-end tests with:

  ```bash
  ng e2e
  ```

These tests help ensure application stability and correctness throughout development.
